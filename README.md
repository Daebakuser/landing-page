# landing-page

As part of The Odin Project's curriculum, I'll be creating a web page, a 
landing page in particular.
The goal is to follow The Odin Project's guidelines to create
an effective and engaging entry point for visitors to showcase my
understanding of HTML and CSS, and to demonstrate my skills in
web development.
